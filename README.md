# Work Day Scheduler

This is a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

This application utilizes the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. The hours of the day dynamically change color depending on if they are past, present or future. 

Additionally, events in the schedule are saved to local storage and persist after page refresh.
